        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>
          I started out making games within a software called construct 3 when i was 12. Honestly not sure what made me find out about construct but i know for sure i began just to spite my mum for not letting me install games on my computer. i learned them simply so i could make my own, not technically installing games right? clearly i was the most intelligent 12 year old, destined for IT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunatly computer science wasnt available during covid times so i had to develop my programming as a hobby during my early days. mostly focusing on learning game engines and i managed to settle on godot , simply pythonic syntax and a modular system perfect for me.
        </p>
        <p> 
          As time went on i developed my skills over time , project over project having fun and just enjoying what i did. Hoping someday id be able to make a living off of it.
