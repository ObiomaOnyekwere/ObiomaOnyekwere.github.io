          I started out making games within a software called construct 3 when i was 12. Honestly not sure what made me find out about construct but I know for sure I began just to spite my mum for not letting me install commercial games on my computer. I learned them simply so I could make my own, not technically installing games right? Clearly I was the most intelligent 12 year old, destined for greatness.

          Unfortunately computer science isn't available during covid times so i had to develop my programming as a hobby during my early days. I mostly focused on learning game engines and I managed to settle on godot , simply pythonic syntax and a modular system perfect for me.

          As time went on I developed my skills over time , project over project, having fun and just enjoying what I did. Hoping someday I'd be able to make a living off of it.
