          Hello my name is obioma onyekwere and as a personal note here me when i started programming all those years ago, when i was in year 7. Wow look at how time flies? 
        </p>

        <p>
          I started out making games within a software called construct 3 when i was 12. Honestly not sure what made me find out about construct but I know for sure I began just to spite my mum for not letting me install any games on my computer. I learned them simply so I could make my own, not technically installing games right?
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately computer science isn't available during covid times so i had to develop my programming as a hobby during my early days. I mostly focused on learning game engines and I managed to settle on godot , simply pythonic syntax and a modular system perfect for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          As time went on I developed my skills over time , project over project, having fun and just enjoying what I did. Hoping someday I'd be able to make a living off of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          This website is here to show off all i've done following my passion for computer science , i really hope you enjoyed my website and thank you for reading.
