      <h2>BMO</h2>

      <p>
        Project BMO :2023-2024! Is a project I began working on in the summer of 2023 as a personal project to recreate BMO from adventure time into a real robot game boy inspired companion! I have an entire pdf related to BMO and the difficulties I faced while producing him right.. <div class="Contacters"><a href="2D_Assets/Project BMO.pdf" style="text-decoration: none;" download="Project_Log">-HERE-. </a></div>

      <h3>Comatosis</h3>

      <p>
        Comatosis is a five nights at Freddy's clone type of game created using the godot game engine. It was published on itch.io on 09 May , 2023. Last updated around December, the game hosts: 5 main game nights , a custom night mode, secret minigames and even a full minigame contained within the extras menu. Artwork was created by a friend of mine but other than that, audio and code was all by me.

      <h4>Portfolio Website.</h4>

      <p>
        You may be surprised but even this website was a bit of a small side project. As of writing this I'm still in the process of creating it but I estimate it will most certainly be done before august 2024 ends. This website was made using a mixture of html,css,javascript and the framework threejs for all the 3d effects you see on the screen. plus vite to package it all up for me. Pretty good for my second experience with webdev.

        <h1>Unfinished Projects</h1>
        <small>...theres a lot of them! i suggest grabbing a coffee.</small> 

        <h2>Rover 72</h2>

        <p>
          Rover 72 is a project inspired by the hit games , iron lung and voyager 19. Its a space retro horror game taking place on mars, where the player is a rover that goes around exploring mars , while trying to survive the harsh elements. The game was made using the godot game engine , all assets except the mars terrain was made by me. If you wish to play it , you can with the link ... right -here-

        <h3>Barnabys bananza</h3>
  
        <p>
          Another attempt at five nights at freddy's type game , this time retro 3d and in a first person view. I tried to continue working on this during my course but considering bmo was still on i was not going to get very far with it, its unfortunately going to be a running trend of these unfinished projects having a very small amount of content within them. This one in particular really only has a simple main room, some code and some audio. Nonetheless, the younger me tried.

        <h4>Aperiophobia</h4>

        <p>
          Another weird one that's sort of supposed to be a cool retro horror game but this one's more vibrant as it's supposed to mimic early n64 type games, it exists as a simple arg sort of thing where the player is playing on the ataris equivalent of the n64 and playing a game. The game really only contains a bit of audio , a map or 2 and from what I can tell a simple ai. I tried to make it manoeuvre in a maze and even chase after the player. not sure if i ever managed to get it working though.

        <h6>C# College project , short game in unity</h6>

        <p>
          This one technically wasnt meant to be finished , its a small game created using the unity game engine and utilizing C# , it was a generic 2d platformer taking various elements from games like sonic , mario etc.

        <p>
          And to be honest this isn't even a 10th of all the mini projects or small things that helped me figure out the basics in construct, in fact there's up to 80 of them from what I recall in my google drive.
