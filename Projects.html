      <h3>Comatosis</h3>

      <p>
        Comatosis is a five nights at freddys clone type of game created using the godot game engine. It was published on itch.io on the 09 May , 2023. Last updated around december , the game hosts 5 main game nights , a custom night mode, secret minigames and even a full minigame contained within the extras menu. Artwork was created by a friend of mine but other than that, audio and code was all by me.

      <h4>Portfolio Website.</h4>

      <p>
        You may be surprised but even this website was a bit of a small side project i worked on, as of writing this im still in the process of creating it but i estimate it will most certainly be done before august 2024 ends. This website was made using a mixture of html,css,javascript and the framework threejs for all the 3d effects you see on the screen. plus vite to package it all up. Pretty impressive?

        <h2>Rover 72</h2>

        <p>
            Rover 72 is a project inspired by the hit games , iron lung and voyager 19. Its a space retro horror game taking place on mars, where the player is a rover that goes around exploring mars , while trying to survive the harsh elements. The game was made using the godot game engine , all assets except the mars terrain was made by me. If you wish to play it , you can with the link ... right -here-

        <h3>Barnabys bananza</h3>
  
        <p>
            Another attempt at a five nights at freddies type game , this time retro 3d and in a first person view. I tried to continue working on this during my course but considering bmo was still on i was not going to get very far with it, its unfortunatly going to be a running trend of these unfinished projects having a very small amount of content within them. This one in particular really only having a simple main room, some code and some audio. nonetheless younger me tried.

        <h4>Aperiophobia</h4>

        <p>
            Another wierd one thats sort of supposed to be a cool retro horror game but this ones more vibrant as its supposed to mimic early n64 type games, it exists as a simple arg sort of thing where the player is playing on the ataris equivalent of the n64 and playing a game. The game really only contains a bit of audio , a map or 2 and from what i can tell a simple ai. i tried to make that would manouvere in a maze and even chase after the player. not sure if i ever managed to get it working though.

        <p>And to be honest this isnt even a 10th of all the mini projects or small things that helped me figure out the basics in construct, infact theres up to 80 of them from what i recall in my google drive. i have been quite busy since i discovered programming...</p>
